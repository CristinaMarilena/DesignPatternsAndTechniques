# DesignPatternsAndTechniques

 Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. 
 
 ## Design by contract - getting rid of null parameters in Spring
 
 *It prescribes that software designers should define formal, precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components, which extend the ordinary definition of abstract data types with preconditions, postconditions and invariants. These specifications are referred to as "contracts", in accordance with a conceptual metaphor with the conditions and obligations of business contracts.*
 
 Design by Contract means:

- each method has a precondition (what it expects before being called)
- each method has a postcondition (what it guarantees, what is returned)
- each class has an constraint on its state (class invariant)
